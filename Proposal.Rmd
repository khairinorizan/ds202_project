```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Dataset Link

I have decided to use two datasets to complete this project:\
\
1. Amazon Prime Movies and TV shows: <https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/amazon-prime-movies-and-tv-shows>\
2. Netflix Movies and TV shows: <https://www.kaggle.com/syedmubarak/netflix-dataset-latest-2021>\

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
